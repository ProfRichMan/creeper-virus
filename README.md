# creeper-virus
CREATION Was created by Bob Thomas in the year, 1971 and happende to be the first self replicating computer virus.
PURPOSE
Creeper was designed as a test to demonstrate the possibility of a self-replicating program and to explore the potential for such programs to spread across networks. 
FUNCTIONALITY
It moved between DEC PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system using the ARPANET, displaying the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" on infected computers. 
INTENT
Unlike modern malware, Creeper didn't cause data loss, destruction, or encryption. Its purpose was purely experimental
REAPER
In response to Creeper, Ray Tomlinson in 1972 developed a program called "Reaper" to remove Creeper from infected systems, marking an early form of antivirus software. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF REAPER
Unlike Creeper, which was a self-replicating experiment, Reaper was designed to track and delete Creeper from infected systems on ARPANET and was considered first Anti virus software  and alsoIt marked the beginning of cybersecurity measures against self-propagating threats.
